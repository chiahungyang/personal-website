Chia-Hung is a PhD candidate of Network Science at Northeastern University, United States. He is facinated by the emergent and adaptive nature of complex systems, where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. He explores how network science, as an abstraction of complex system modeling, can unveil novel or strengthen existing understanding of theories of biological evolution. Concurrently, he is also interested in expanding the toolkit of network science to model complex systems, including general guidelines of message passing approaches and methods of network reconstruction from time series data.
