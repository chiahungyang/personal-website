Chia-Hung is a PhD of Network Science graduated from Northeastern University, United States. His graduate research explored how network science, as an abstraction of complex system modeling, can unveil novel or strengthen existing understanding of theories of biological evolution. He also collaborated with colleagues to expand network science toolkits to model complex systems, including general guidelines of message passing approaches and network reconstruction from time series data. Recently, Chia-Hung grows interests in deep learning application of anomaly detection and self-supervised representation for biomedical signals.
