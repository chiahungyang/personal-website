Starting from the NetSI Collabothon in 2019, the awesome team led by [Brennan Klein](https://www.jkbrennan.com/) have put together Python library called [netrd](https://github.com/netsiphd/netrd) that consolidates methods that reconstruct networks from time series data, compare dissimilarity between networks, and generate time series from dynamical models on networks.

We recently submitted this project to the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) (which does all peer review process on GitHub, so cool!), and this preprint [netrd: A library for network reconstruction and graph distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16019) gives a peek of the overall scope of the library.
