Our new paper "[The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6490/493)"
is just out in Science, where I helped digitalize the real-time human mobility data in China.

Huge thanks to our international team leading by [Moritz Kraemer](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-moritz-kraemer) and
