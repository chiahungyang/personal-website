I am happy to work with [Hanyu Chwe](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/people/hanyu-chwe) and put together the [2nd Annual Network Science Research Symposium](https://netsiphd.github.io/symposium/) in [NetSI](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/).

It was also great to share my recent work towards general message passing approaches on networks with cycles.
