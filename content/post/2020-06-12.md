Our new preprint "[Reproductive barriers as a byproduct of gene network evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.147322v4)"
is just out on bioRxiv. In this work, we introduce the *pathway framework* of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that abstract genotypes by the expression behavior of genes. This mathematical framework allows us to easily generalize population genetic model from a few loci to conceptually the whole GRN, and our simulations implicate that allopatric speciation rapidly arises as the GRNs evolve.

Stay tuned on more theoretical advances of what the pathway framework can do!
