After months of discussion, [Tzu-Chi Yen](https://junipertcy.info/) and I put together a Traditional Chinese translation of the [Complexity Explained](https://complexityexplained.github.io/) booklet.
It is a great resource that highlights the key concepts and charms in complex systems science.
You can the translated version [here](https://complexityexplained.github.io/ComplexityExplained[Chinese].pdf).
